    "This assignment consists of two problems presented in a puzzle game context. For the first problem, you will be implementing a path search problem along with common search algorithms and evaluating their properties. For the second problem, you will be exploring how to define and solve a constraint satisfaction problem. To implement the solutions, you have to use AIPython code that provides you with many implemented classes and examples of their use.  \n",

For heuristic based on Manhattan and Euclidean distance, the A* algorithm will finally find the optimal path. But for heuristic based on inversions, the algorithm fails to find the optimal path in start23.\n",

Obviously, the function that calculates heuristic has remarkbale effect on the performance of the A* search algorithm. The speed of the A* algorithm based on different heuristic is (Manhattan > Euclidean > Inversions) in my experiment.\n",

    "It could be concluded that Manhattan is better and Inversions is the worst for calculating the heuristic for this task. The h-value for Manhattan is more closer to the actural least cost to the goal node. Besides, the h-value for both Manhattan and Euclidean is generally less than the actual cost of moving to the goal. This ensures that the A* search algorithm will find the optimal path. However, Manhattan is still bettern than Euclidean. Manhattan is more suitable for this task, since the number in each node could only move right, left, top or bottom. Thus Manhattan distance is more close to the actual cost than the Euclidean distance. It should be also noticed that the h-value for Manhattan is bigger than that for Euclidean. The less h-value is, the more number of nodes A* will expand, resulting the speed of A* being slower.\n",

    "Inversions fails to find the optimal path in start 23. This is because the h-value of Inversions is much greater than the actural least cost from the current node to the goal node. In another word, Inversions could not represent the actual cost from current state to the goal state. Thus, A* based on Inversionns is less likely to choose the optimal path, which makes the speed of it being very slow than the other two.\n"

Compared with IDS which uses depth as the threshold and update it by increasing one each time, IDA uses f() = g() + h() as the threshold. This means IDA will stop expanding the node if it is estimated not at the optimal path. IDA only needs store a stack of nodes which represents the branch of the tree it is expanding, and such 'pruning' results in IDA bebing more efficient than IDS(Space Complexity O(d) for IDA but O(bd) for IDS).\n",
    "Although all of A*, BFS and UCS uses FrontierPQ, A* uses less memory since A* is a heuristic search but BFS is a blind search. A* uses heuristic function to choose the best action. In this task, the cost of each action is the same (1). Thus UCS is equal to BFS in this task, but UCS does not check whether the node has been expanded, which means nodes may be added to the frontier repeatedly and the algorithm is likely to fall into a circulation, and the memory space will be used up soon.\n",

    "I choose the DFS search algorithm in this task. The depth of the search tree is limited and must has an end in this task. Thus DFS could must find a solution if there is a solution. The constraints of upper nodes are limited. However, with the increasement of the depth, the constraints are becoming more complex. The target of the Sudoku game is find an answer, rather the way that can find the anwer is the best is not important. So heuristic(A*, IDA) is not necessary. IDA also would visited upper node in the search tree many times, which wastes time and space.\n",

    "Compared with BFS (equal to UCS in this task) and A*, DFS is more space efficiency. In addition, the result(answer) locates at the bottom of the search tree. Thus DFS is more efficient than BFS since in BFS, the node at the bottom will be visited at last. This advantage would be expanded especially in the case that the Sudoku game has more than one solution. This is also the reason why I don't use IDS. Limiting the depth is meaningless in this task, but will cost much more time."
